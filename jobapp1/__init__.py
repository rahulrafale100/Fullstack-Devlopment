    # applications" which can be all pulled together by the main
    # application to create the whole app. Blueprints can also share
    # code so that duplication is limited.  Refer to
    # https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/

    # We create the application as a python package. This page
    # describes how it works.
    # https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages. We
    # import the jobs module in this package and then register the
    # blueprint we've created in there into the main application
    # thereby adding all the URLs defined inside jobs to the main app.
